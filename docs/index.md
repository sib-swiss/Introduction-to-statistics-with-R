### General learning outcomes

At the end of this course, participants will be able to:
- have experience in the application of basic statistics techniques
- know how to summarize data with numerical and graphical summaries
- plot data
- do hypothesis testing and multiple testing correction
- linear models
- correlation and regression
- principal component analysis and other topics

### Learning outcomes explained

To reach the general learning outcomes above, we have set a number of smaller learning outcomes. Each chapter starts with these smaller learning outcomes. Use these at the start of a chapter to get an idea what you will learn. Use them also at the end of a chapter to evaluate whether you have learned what you were expected to learn.

## Learning experiences

The course will combine lectures on statistics and practical exercises, during which the participants will learn how to work with the widely used "R" language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

Participants will also have the opportunity to ask questions about the analysis of their own data.

### Exercises

Each block has practical work involved. Some more than others. The practicals are subdivided into chapters, and we'll have a (short) discussion after each chapter. Some answers to the practicals are incorporated, but they are hidden. Do the exercise first by yourself, before checking out the answer. If your answer is different from the answer in the practicals, try to figure out why they are different.

### Asking questions
During lectures, you are encouraged to raise your hand if you have questions.
